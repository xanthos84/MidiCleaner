Remove Silence / silent parts from the beginning of midi files

Useful for music producers who get a lot of midi packs where the notes start not on the very first beat but instead after 4,8,16 bars.
So this python script removes the silence so the notes starting from the very beginning when you drag the midi file into your DAW.
